%% Summary
% This document will outline the major features and functionality of the
% code-base developed at Q-State for the analysis of high-throughput
% screening data.  First I'll give a short narrative description of the
% major modules, and that will be followed by a series of examples
% outlining how major features are intended to be used.
% 
% In keeping with Q-State's historically boring (and descriptive) naming
% scheme, the primary function to call for generating HTS analyses is
% AnalyzeHts().  This pipeline was designed and built with HTS data in mind,

% 1. Ways to get data into AnalyzeHts
%%% %%%% %%% %%% %%% %%% %%% %%% %%% %%% %%% %%% %%% %%% %%% %%% %%% %%% %%% %%%
% Fundamentally, AnalyzeHts works on feature tables, but there are several
% useful variations on getting feature tables into AnalyzeHts(), each of
% which may work for you in different contexts, depending on what you're
% trying to achieve.
% 
%% 1.1 Pass in a feature table you've already got.
% Depending on your workflow, you may already have an SFT saved, either
% produced from AnalyzeProject() or downloaded from OptoDB.  If so, using
% AnalyzeHts() is as simple as loading that SFT in from the disk and
% passing it in as a name-value pair, like so:

% Load a feature table, 'sft_ucb', into memory
sft_ucb = table();

a= 7;
b = a-4;


%% 1.2 Request a feature table from OptoDB as a part of HTS analysis
% If you don't already have an SFT, you can request one as a part of
% running the HTS analysis, and if you provide the correct information,
% AnalyzeHts() will go off and download it and then proceed with analysis.
% If your plates were barcoded, you can use the barcodes for all requested
% plates to request that SFT.  (To be specific here, to the software, your
% plates only count as being barcoded if the movies produced have a
% metadata field titled 'cellPlateBarcodes' and that field contains a
% string uniquely identifying each plate that gets loaded into OptoDB).
% For example, this first call should produce exactly the same figures as 
% from §1.1:

% load('S:\SoftwareTesting\testHtsOutputs\data\sft.mat')
dd=12;

%% 1.3 Passing in an analyses object to do a time-bin analysis
% The AnalyzeHts() pipeline supports the Time-Bin analysis, originally
% developed by Kit.  In order to conduct this analysis, detailed
% information about the stimulation protocol and spike-timing is needed
% that isn't stored in source feature tables, so we have to compute that
% information from an analyses.savefast file for a given experiment.  A
% full discsusion of that code-base is outside the scope of this vignette,
% but see MakeTimeBinSpecification, BuildTimeBinTable, and

% 2. Different scoring functions
%%% %%%% %%% %%% %%% %%% %%% %%% %%% %%% %%% %%% %%% %%% %%% %%% %%% %%% %%% %%%
% AnalyzeHts() allows you to specify many different scoring functions which
% produce 'disease scores' or 'phenotype scores.'  Many of these functions
% have their own required parameters, so you have to be attentive to those
% requirements when requesting more scores.  I will discuss a few of these
% in detail here, and the remaining detail will be found in
% HtsScoringVignette.m.  
% 
% All scoring functions are named "HtsScore_*.m" to make them easy to find.
% They all follow the following signature:
%   [htsData, scoreTable] = HtsScore_ScoreFcn( htsData, varargin )
% 
% So every scoring function receives htsData (a data structure containing
% all the data you have requested, so SFTs or time bin tables or aggregated
% versions thereof) and all the options, and returns a table of scores for
% every well.
% 
% A couple highlights:
%   * HtsScore_SelectColumns() - Allows you to specify individual parametric
%     features to get selected as scores.  Useful if your phenotype is well 
%     described by features already in your feature table, or if it specifically
%     affects a small subset of features and you want to see figures for them
%     all.
%   * HtsScore_OverallLda() - Generates a composite score, combining several
%     user-specified features into one new column by a weighted average.
%     Weights set using a 'Linear Discriminant Analysis'

%% 2.1 Requesting multiple existing features using _SelectColumns()
