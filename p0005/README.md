### Problem \#5 - Smallest Common Multiple
Okay, they give us the solution for the digits 1-10. The naive solution to a 'common multiple' problem is to just take the product of all the digits involved - 1\*2\*3\*4\*5\*6\*7\*8\*9\*10. For a smallest common multiple problem, however, we can do better than this, there is clearly redundancy in this list. Any number that is a product of 2 and 5, for example, is also a product of 10. With this perspective in mind, consider the example given in the problem statement - 2,520 is the smallest common multiple of the digits 1-10. It turns out this is the product of 2, 4, 5, 7, and 9. 10 is unnecessary for the reason stated above. 8 is unnecessary because if we include 2 and 4, our product is necessarily an integer multiple of 8. 6 and 3 come along for free as long as we keep 2 and 9.

We can follow a similar approach to tackle the digits from 1-20 using this list as a starting point. [Solution](https://github.com/stevejryan/ProjectEuler/tree/master/p0005/Solution.MD).
