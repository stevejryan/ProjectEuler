### Problem \#5 - Smallest Common Multiple, Solution
If we start from the set [2, 4, 5, 7, 9] which covers the original 1-10 problem, and add the interval from 11-20, there are a few numbers we can add quickly. All the primes in 11-20 are necessarily not covered by our solution for 1-10, so we have to add 11, 13, 17, and 19. 12 is covered by 9 and 4; 14 is covered by 2 and 7; 15 is covered by 5 and 9; 18 is covered by 2 and 9; 20 is covered by 4 and 5; 16 is NOT covered by an existing combination, but we can do better than including 16 - since we already have 2, we can include 8 instead of 16. With 8 in the list, we no longer need 4, leaving us with the final, minimal set of integers between 1 and 20 whose product is the smallest common multiple of ALL numbers from 1-20 - [2, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19].
